# AgeGroup-based-Death-Monitoring

### Can we predict German deaths?? Let's find out.
Hi all fellow hobby-epidemiologists,

this analysis delves into German deaths based on data by [destatis](https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Umwelt/Bevoelkerung/Sterbefaelle-Lebenserwartung/Tabellen/sonderauswertung-sterbefaelle.html;jsessionid=D5059F400B46230E5778173BD23E8094.internet712) . Let's find out, if we can predict German deaths by treating viruses as black-box model and predict seasonal death-waves only from past observations (death and population distributions). So we don't care about the virus classification schemes like flu A/B or Corona. We also don't care about DNA, the infectiousness or dangerousness of viruses. The only prior information, we may incorporate is that virus-waves emerge during winter and heat-waves occur during summer. The virus-season starts every year in the beginning of October and ends in the end of May (see RKI). The rest of the year will be denoted as heat-season.



### Let's start with plotting annual deaths decomposed into Age Groups
We start by decomposing the total death signal into age groups. Look at the first plot and try to find your age group. Can you see waves in your age group? No?,.. then you probably belong to a young age group. Yes!, then you belong definitly to an older age group. And this our first observation. Old people cause seasonality in deaths and young people don't. Let's re-check this for each year. However, the pattern remains the same: Below age 45 age-bands remain mainly flat (non-seasonal age groups) while above 45 age-bands start to form waves (seasonal age groups).
